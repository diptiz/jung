== How to avoid edge crossings? ==

We don't provide layout algorithms that do that directly.  Even checking for edge crossings requires considering all pairs of edges, which is prohibitively expensive.  The force-directed algorithms generally avoid this as an emergent property of the forces in play, but we provide no guarantees in any of the algorithms for general graphs that we provide.
